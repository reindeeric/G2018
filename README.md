# G2018

The main purpose of this project is to write a programme that helps computing the output of a logic circuit. A logic circuit is a circuit made up of arbitraty levels of logic gates. Each logic gate can take in up to 3 inputs and produce only 1 output except NOT gate which can only take in 1 input and produce 1 output. 

Users will key in their circuit inputs and also their circuit connection in the table shown in gates.csv. The program will then read gates.csv and extract the information keyed-in by the users and use that information to make computations. The programme should be written based on the code skeleton provided in sample.cpp with the use of inheritance and operator overloading. The logic circuit have arbitraty levels of gates, arbitraty inputs but has only one output. The output computed will be written into a .csv file.

main.cpp and OOP Assignment 1.h are the codes in progress.
